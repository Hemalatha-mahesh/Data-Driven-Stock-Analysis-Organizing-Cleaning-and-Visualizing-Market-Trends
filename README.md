**Project Title:**

Data-Driven Stock Analysis: Organizing, Cleaning, and Visualizing Market Trends

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on leveraging data analytics techniques to understand and interpret stock market trends through systematic data organization, cleaning, and visualization. The goal is to transform raw financial data into meaningful insights that can support better investment and trading decisions.

The project involves collecting stock market datasets from reliable sources, performing data preprocessing to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies. Statistical and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are used to detect patterns, correlations, and outliers among stock prices, trading volumes, and financial indicators.

Through the use of Python and visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, interactive dashboards and visual summaries are created to display price movements, volatility trends, and inter-sector performance comparisons. The cleaned and visualized data helps uncover key insights about market behavior, company performance, and sectoral dynamics over time.

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced predictive analytics or machine learning-based forecasting in stock market research.

**Key Objectives:**

Collect and organize historical stock market data from reliable financial APIs or CSV datasets.

Clean and preprocess data by handling missing, inconsistent, or duplicate records.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify correlations, patterns, and market trends.

Visualize insights using interactive and static plots to represent time-series trends, volatility, and sector performance.

Provide actionable insights to assist in data-driven investment strategies.

**Tools and Technologies:**

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Platforms: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
